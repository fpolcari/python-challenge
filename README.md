# python-challenge
This python-challenge module has two main python scripts with their respective CSV files to inform some of the computations, and a separate text file that is created after the scripts run.
Beginning with the PyBank folder, I was tasked with creating a Python script called main.py that analyzes the records provided (budget_data.csv) to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results. The exported text file gets saved to the analysis folder and saves under the naming convention: FinancialAnalysis.txt

The second folder labeled PyPoll contains a separate Python script called main.py that was written to help a small, rural community modernize it's vote-counting process. I was provided with poll data via a election_data.csv file. The goal was to create a python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
The  final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file to the folder labeled "analysis" and saves the results to a text file labeled: ElectionResults.txt
